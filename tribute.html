				<h4>Beginning with the big bang</h4>
          <p>Hawking was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a degenerative motor neurone disease that quickly robs
             people of the ability to voluntarily move their muscles. He was told he had two years
              to live. Although Hawking’s body may have weakened, his intellect stayed sharp.
              Hawking had his own scientific vision to investigate the beginning of time.
          </p>
          <h4>Time’s arrow</h4>
          <p>Hawking was studying the work of Roger Penrose, which proved that if Einstein’s general theory 
            of relativity is correct, at the heart of every black hole must be a point where 
            space and time themselves break down – a singularity. Hawking realised that 
            if time’s arrow were reversed, the same reasoning would hold true for the 
            universe as a whole. Under Sciama’s encouragement, he worked out the maths and 
            was able to prove it: the universe according to general relativity began 
            in a singularity.</p>
          <h4>Thermodynamic threat</h4>
          <p>The second law of thermodynamics is one of the most well-established laws
             of nature. It states that the entropy, or level of disorder in a system, 
             always increases. The second law gives form to the observation that ice 
             cubes will melt into a puddle, but a puddle of water will never 
             spontaneously turn into a block of ice. All matter contains entropy, 
             so what happens when it is dropped into a black hole? Is entropy lost
              along with it? If so, the total entropy of the universe goes down and
               black holes would violate the second law of thermodynamics.</p>
          <h4>Bekenstein and breakthrough</h4>
          <p>In 1972, at a physics summer school in France, Stephen Hawking encountered
             Jacob Bekenstein, a graduate student who proposed that the second law of 
             thermodynamics, specifically the concept of entropy, should apply to black
              holes. Bekenstein suggested that the growth of a black hole's event 
              horizon as it consumes matter could represent an increase in entropy. 
              Initially, Hawking opposed the idea, believing it flawed. However,
               after attempting to disprove it, he instead confirmed the relationship 
               between entropy and a black hole's horizon, leading to one of his
                greatest scientific breakthroughs.</p>
          <h4>Hawking Radiation</h4>
          <p>Stephen Hawking embraced the idea that black holes could have entropy and
             therefore emit radiation, a concept he initially resisted. By combining general
              relativity with quantum mechanics, he discovered that black holes emit what is
               now known as Hawking radiation. This occurs when particle-antiparticle pairs 
               form near the event horizon, and one escapes while the other is captured by the
                black hole. Although difficult to experimentally confirm, Hawking radiation is
                 widely accepted as his most significant scientific contribution.</p>
          <h4>Theory of everything</h4>
          <p>The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy equation, which unites constants from 
            gravity, quantum mechanics, relativity, and thermodynamics, was engraved 
            on Stephen Hawking's tombstone, symbolizing his pursuit of a unified
             theory of physics. However, his discovery that black holes can radiate 
             and eventually evaporate led to the black hole information loss paradox,
              which challenges key principles of quantum mechanics and relativity. 
              In 1976, Hawking controversially argued that black holes do lose
               information when they evaporate, sparking a debate that continues to
                be one of the most significant challenges in theoretical physics.</p>
          <h4>Concession</h4>
          <p>In 2004, he dramatically reversed his stance at a conference in Dublin, 
            declaring that black holes cannot lose information. This issue, central 
            to the quest for quantum gravity, remains unresolved, with new paradoxes 
            like the firewall emerging. Although Hawking's most influential work was 
            in the 1970s, his later efforts in quantum cosmology and his unique 
            problem-solving methods continued to push the boundaries of theoretical 
            physics.</p>
          <h4>Hawking the superstar</h4>
          <p>His genre-defining book, A Brief History of Time, has sold more than 10 million 
            copies since its publication in 1988, and has been translated into more than 35 
            languages. He was a world-leading theoretical physicist, clearly the 
            best in the world for his time among those working at the intersection of
             gravity and quantum mechanics, and he did it all in the face of a 
             terrible disease. He is an inspirational figure, and history will 
             certainly remember him that way. </p>
